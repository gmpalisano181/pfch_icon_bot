# pfch_icon_bot

wimmelbuch (german, lit. "teeming book"): A collection of full-spread drawings, typified by their busy focus and intricate detail. Popularized
by Dutch and Netherlandish Renaissance artists such as Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel.

===ABOUT===

This github repository contains all of the documentation that was used for the creation of ICON_bot, a twitter bot which can be located at the 
following url: https://twitter.com/wimmelbuch.

The purpose of the project is to provide visual accompaniments to randomly-selected notations derived from Iconclass, using the Rijksmuseum's 
digital collection. Iconclass is a hierarchical, semi-faceted classification system currently maintained by the Netherlands Institute for Art 
History. The data generated by this code supplies content to a twitter bot which updates its status three times per day.


===COMPONENTS===

The repository consists of five files:

<ic_reader.py> - This python code converts a raw .ndjson file containing all of Iconclass into a usable .json array. All 1.5 million 
    permutations currently possible under Iconclass's current headings are extracted and arranged as a list in a single output file. This 
    makes the data usable for the other files in the repository.

<rijks_inv_req.py> - This python code extracts the entirety of the digital collection made available through the Rijksmuseum's API. The 
    file's output is a directory of .json files, wherein each file corresponds to the full metadata for each object in the collection. Running this 
    code is not actually necessary for the finished process and has been substituted here with a standard API request so that the code can
    run without the inclusion of the large directory. However, using a local directory created by this file does increase the speed and 
    consistency of data_generator.py

<rijks_dir_reader.py> - This python code converts the entire directory created by the previous file into a single .json file that only 
    includes the most pertinent details about each object, with respect to the selection process. This stripped-down output file is essential to 
    optimal performance, since the selection process may have to iterate through the entire collection several hundred times before it finds a 
    suitable match.

The above three files each only need to be run once, unless more current information is desired to reflect future updates made to either 
Iconclass or the Rijksmuseum API. The following two files are run each time the ICON_bot updates its status.

<data_generator.py> - This python code is central element of the process. It will generate a pseudo-random notation drawn from the 
    ic_reader.py output file, and then iterate through the entire directory of objects looking for matches. Any matches will be added to a list. 
    If the code loops through the entire inventory without finding any matches, it will start over. When it completes a loop with one or more 
    items added to the list, it will perform another pseudo-random selection to generate the chosen item for the tweet. The code will then 
    extract structured data from the object's full metadata and feed it into three output files: writing a temporary file (overwritten each time 
    the code runs), appending an archive file (which contains information about every time this code was successfully run), and downloading a 
    temporary image (this will also be overwritten each time the code runs).

<tweet_generator.py> - This python code takes the temporary file produced by data_generator.py and utilizes the content to generate text strings 
    which are subsequently used for a status update. The file has three outputs: a tweet, which includes an uploaded image, and two subtweets. 
    The code forces a 10 second pause between each one so that there is time for the tweet to post before the process searches for it in order to 
    subtweet it. 

Additionally, there are two file folders, data and twitter files. The former holds any output from the first three files, and the latter stores 
the temporary and archival files created by data_generator.py
